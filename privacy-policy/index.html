        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-6">
          Any personal information we hold will be governed by our most current privacy notice.

        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-6">
          Cumulus9 Limited (“Cumulus9”) provides quality assurance testing services in respect of regulatory reporting,
          including but not limited to reference data testing, accuracy testing and regulatory reconciliations to
          international clients and is the data controller of your personal information in relation to those services.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-6">
          Please note that if you are a Cumulus9 employee, your personal information will be used in connection with
          your employment contract. Any reference to ‘us’, ‘our’, ‘we’ or ‘Cumulus9’ in this privacy notice is a
          reference to Cumulus9. Similarly, any reference to ‘you’, ‘your’, ‘yours’ or ‘yourself’ in this privacy notice
          is a reference to any of our customers and potential customers as the context requires unless otherwise
          stated.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">What kind of personal information do we collect?</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-6">
          If you are an actual or potential customer, we may collect the following types of information about you:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 text-gray-600">

          We obtain this information in a number of ways through your use of our services or other dealings with us
          including through the Cumulus9 website, the customer on-boarding process, marketing sign up forms, subscribing
          to blogs and from information provided in the course of ongoing customer service correspondence. We may also
          obtain personal information about you through your use of our website or through the use of cookies on our
          website and, in particular by recording which pages you look at on our website.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-6">
          We may ask for other personal information voluntarily from time to time (for example, through market research
          or surveys). We may record any communications—electronic, by telephone, in person or otherwise—that we have
          with you in relation to the services we provide and our relationship with you. These recordings will be our
          sole property and will constitute evidence of the communications between us. Such telephone conversations may
          be recorded without the use of a warning tone or any other further notice. Further, if you visit our offices
          or premises, we may have CCTV which will record your image.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Who may we disclose personal information to?</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-6">
          As part of using your personal information for the purposes set out above, we may disclose your information
          to:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 text-gray-600">
          <li>other companies in the Cumulus9 Group</li>
          <li>service providers and specialist advisers who have been contracted to provide us with administrative, IT,

          Generally, we require that third party organisations who handle or obtain personal information acknowledge the
          confidentiality of this information, undertake to respect any individual’s right to privacy and comply with
          all relevant data protection laws and this privacy notice.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">How do we obtain your consent?</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-6">
          Where our use of your personal information requires your consent, such consent will be provided in accordance
          with the applicable terms and conditions of use on our website or any other contract we may have entered into
          with you or as set out in our communication with you from time to time. If we rely on your consent as our
          legal basis for processing your personal information, you have the right to withdraw that consent at any time
          by contacting us using the contact details set out in this privacy notice.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Management of personal information</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-6">
          We always take appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure that your information is secure. In
          particular, we train our employees who handle personal information to respect the confidentiality of customer
          information and the privacy of individuals. We regard breaches of your privacy very seriously and will impose
          appropriate penalties, including dismissal where necessary.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">How do we store personal information and for how long?</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-6">
          Safeguarding the privacy of your information is important to us, whether you interact with us personally, by
          phone, by mail, over the internet or any other electronic medium. We hold personal information in a
          combination of secure computer storage facilities and paper-based files and other records, and take steps to
          protect the personal information we hold from misuse, loss, unauthorised access, modification or disclosure.
          When we consider that personal information is no longer needed, we will remove any details that will identify
          you or we will securely destroy the records. However, we may need to maintain records for a significant period
          of time.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-6">
          If we hold any personal information in the form of a deed, we will hold this deed in its complete form for a
          period of 12 years after our business relationship with you has ended. If we hold any personal information in
          the form of a recorded communication, by telephone, electronic, in person or otherwise, this information will
          be held in line with local regulatory requirements which will either be 5 years or 10 years after our business
          relationship with you has ended. Where you have opted out of receiving marketing communications we may hold
          your details on our suppression list so that we know you do not want to receive these communications but we
          will not send you marketing communications.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">How do we use the personal information?</h2>
